Hi, I’m @CharlesLim17
I'm a Junior Software Developer and a 4th Year BSIT student from Polytechnic University of the Philippines

Currently I'm working on projects that involves:
- Front end development using html, css, bootstrap, HTMX
- Back end development using django
- Android Development using xml, kotlin, java, firebase
- Mobile Development using flutter, riverpod

I use github to:
- To upload my projects for my own archives
- To collaborate with team members
- To track my improvements from one project to another
