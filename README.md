Hi, I’m @CharlesLim17
I'm a 4th Year BSIT student from Polytechnic University of the Philippines

Currently I'm working on projects that involves:
- Front end development using html, css, angular, react, vue js
- Back end development using php
- Android Development using kotlin, firebase

I use github to:
- To upload my projects for my own archives
- To collaborate with team members
- To track my improvements from one project to another
